## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to style radio buttons to look more like regular buttons (that's new for me) and how to manipulate the class list for DOM elements using [`Element.classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList).

Update 20221005:

Safari didn't adhere to my submit button (`<input type="submit" />`) style on iOS. I let it slide, but it bothered me that it wasn't working.

It seems like it's been a problem with Safari since 2009.

It has been fixed on macOS, but not iOS, which has more active users in general.

To fix it, add the following CSS:

```css
input {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
}
```

Now all your input elements (like `<input type="submit" />`) should work correctly on Safari iOS.

Waiting for Apple to fix this, tho ðŸ’€.

### Continued development

Excited for the upcoming frontendmentor.io projects which add more JavaScript into the mix!

## Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to [@elaineleung](https://github.com/elaineleung) and [@Orodan](https://github.com/Orodan) for their [respective](https://github.com/elaineleung/frontendmentor/tree/main/interactiveratingcomponent) [solutions](https://github.com/Orodan/interactive-rating-component-main/).

Without reading a little bit of both, this solution wouldn't exist.

I implemented @elaineleung's radio buttons styling and how to interact with the radio buttons and card form in my script.

And I used @Orodan's idea to add the raw HTML thanks card to my `index.html`, and hiding the corresponding card using a `hidden` class (using `display: none`) and `Element.classList.add()` and `Element.classList.remove()` in my script to toggle the `hidden` class.

Thanks to [Sergey](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2591664/sergey) for his answer about ["CSS: Safari on Mac doesn't adhere to my Submit Button style" on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1681826/css-safari-on-mac-doesnt-adhere-to-my-submit-button-style).
